# Nuz + create-react-app

The template created by [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app).

## What is different?

- Installed [@nuz/core](https://github.com/nuz-app/nuz/tree/develop/packages/nuz-core) [react-helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet) as `dependencies` and [@nuz/cli](https://github.com/nuz-app/nuz/tree/develop/packages/nuz-cli) as `devDependencies`.
- Add script `dev-workspace` in package.json.
- A new folder named `workspace` includes `modules` created by [@nuz/cli](https://github.com/nuz-app/nuz/tree/develop/packages/nuz-cli).
- Updated `src/client.js` file to bootstrap in-app.
- Updated `src/App.js` file to use [@nuz/core](https://github.com/nuz-app/nuz/tree/develop/packages/nuz-core).
