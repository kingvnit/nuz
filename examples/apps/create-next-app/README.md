# Nuz + Next.js (with-typescript)

The template is [with-typescript](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-typescript) created by [creact-next-app](https://github.com/zeit/next.js).

## What is different?

- Installed [@nuz/core](https://github.com/nuz-app/nuz/tree/develop/packages/nuz-core) as `dependencies` and [@nuz/cli](https://github.com/nuz-app/nuz/tree/develop/packages/nuz-cli) as `devDependencies`.
- Add script `dev-workspace` in package.json.
- A new folder named `workspace` includes `modules` created by [@nuz/cli](https://github.com/nuz-app/nuz/tree/develop/packages/nuz-cli).
- File `pages/_app.tsx` default of next with some config for [@nuz/core](https://github.com/nuz-app/nuz/tree/develop/packages/nuz-core).
- Updated `next.config.js` file to use helper of [@nuz/core](https://github.com/nuz-app/nuz/tree/develop/packages/nuz-core) for [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), support **server-side-rendering**.
- Updated `pages/index.tsx` file to use [@nuz/core](https://github.com/nuz-app/nuz/tree/develop/packages/nuz-core).
